    "## TL/DR\n",
    "Upload a FASTA file, get a CSV file with per-residue disorder scores for the sequences. No limit on the number of sequences that can be submitted, but in general google-colab notebooks can crash...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known issues:\n",
    "Some anti-tracking tools and other plugins designed to prevent ads will impact the the ability of the notebook to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Known errors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TypeError: google.colab._files is undefined`\n",
    "\n",
    "To diagnose this, we suggest visiting the notebook in an Incognito window, noting you'll still need to sign in.\n",

    "## Format of input\n",
    "The input file must be a correctly formatted FASTA file. This means each sequence is defined by a header (which starts with a `>` character) and then on the NEXT line(s) valid amino acid sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not require FASTA headers to be unique, and invalid amino acids will be as best as they can converted to standard amino acids using the following conversion convention::\n",
    "\n",
    "    B   -> N\n",
    "    U   -> C\n",
    "    X   -> G\n",

    "    \" \" -> <empty string> (i.e. a whitespace character)\n",
    "    *   -> <empty string>\n",
    "    -   -> <empty string>\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, we're using [protfasta](https://protfasta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to parse the FASTA file. If this fails an error message should print and if things really seem to go wrong [please raise an issue on out metapredict issue tracker](https://github.com/idptools/metapredict).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Format of output file\n",
    "The output file is a *bona fide* csv (comma separated variable) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sequence has its own dedicated line, and each line has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Index** (starting at 0). This is a unique number which will be incremented by one. Note if that any sequences fail you'll see a jump in the index as failed sequences are missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Header** this is the FASAT header used\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sequence** the actual sequence used in the prediction. Note we say \"actual\" because it may have been converted if an invalid amino acid was found on parsing (see above).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Disorder values** column 4 onwards is the per-residue disorder score, such that the number of columns is variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE \n",
    "Because we want to guarentee that the output file is a true CSV file any commas in your FASTA headers will be removed and replaced with a semi-colon. You have been warned\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of output sequence predictions is guarenteed to match the input order, and individually invalid sequences will be skipped rather\n",
    "\n",
    "### Help\n",
    "I things go wrong, please don't hesitate to [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/idptools/metapredict)\n",
