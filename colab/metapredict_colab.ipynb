    "# Batch disorder predictions using metapredict\n",
    "#### *Version 1.2* (updated 2022-30-08)\n",
    "This notebook provides a simple interface for performing batch predictions of disorder predictions using metapredict V2.\n",
    "\n",
    "More more information of how metapredict works [please see our preprint]().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## TL/DR\n",
    "Upload a FASTA file, get a CSV file with per-residue disorder scores for the sequences. No limit on the number of sequences that can be submitted, but in general google-colab notebooks can crash...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known issues:\n",
    "Some anti-tracking tools and other plugins designed to prevent ads will impact the the ability of the notebook to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Known errors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TypeError: google.colab._files is undefined`\n",
    "\n",
    "To diagnose this, we suggest visiting the notebook in an Incognito window, noting you'll still need to sign in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More info\n",
    "More details at the end of this page!"
