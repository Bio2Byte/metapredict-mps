=================

IDP-Parrot, created by Dan Griffith, was used to generate the network used for metapredict. See https://pypi.org/project/idptools-parrot/ for some very cool machine learning stuff from Dan.

In addition to using Dan Griffith's tool for creating metapredict, the code for brnn_architecture.py and encode_sequence.py was written by Dan (originally for idptools-Parrot). 

I would also like to thank the team at MobiDB for creating the database that was used to train this predictor. Check out their awesome stuff at https://mobidb.bio.unipd.it

Project based on the 
[Computational Molecular Science Python Cookiecutter](https://github.com/molssi/cookiecutter-cms) version 1.3.
