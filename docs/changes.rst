This section is a log of recent changes with metapredict. My hope is that as I change things, this section can help you figure out why a change was made and if it will break any of your current work flows. The first major changes were made for the 0.56 release, so tracking will start there.


V0.57
-------

Change:
Bug fix that could result in prediction values to six decimal places in some scenarios

Change:
Changed titles for graphs generated by ``metapredict-graph-disorder`` to be 14 characters instead of 10. This is reflected in the title graph and the saved files.

Reason:
The 10 character save file was occassionally the same for multiple proteins. This resulted in the inability to discern which protein corresponded to which graph and could result in overwriting previously generated graphs. The 14 characters should be long enough to keep unique names for all proteins being analyzed.

Change:
Fixed bug that could result in crashing due to short fasta headers.

V0.56
-------

Change:
Number of decimals in predictions was reduced from 6 to 3.
Reason:
It is not necessary to have accuracy out to 6 decimal places.

Change:
Added functionality to use . to specify current directory from command line.
Reason:
Improve functionality.

Change:
-DPI flag changed to -dpi in command line graphing function
Reason:
It was annoying to have to do all caps for this flag.

Change:
The ``predict-disorder`` command is now ``metapredict-predict-disorder`` and the ``graph-disorder`` command is now ``metapredict-graph-disorder``
Reason:
This will help users be able to use auto complete functionality from the command line using tab to pull up the graph or predict disorder commands while only having to remember metapredict.

Change:
The output for .csv files will now have a comma space between each value instead of just a comma.
Reason:
Improve readability.
